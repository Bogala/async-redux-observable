# Redux-observable, asynchronous logic

## First of all
This work is largely inspired from a [medium story of Hendrik Swanepoel](https://medium.com/dailyjs/using-redux-observable-to-handle-asynchronous-logic-in-redux-d49194742522) and a [Netflix Talk with Jay Phelps on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AslncyG8whg).

A big thanks to them !
